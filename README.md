This repository aims to provide a basic example of a `Good Reporsitory`. There are several ideas of what can we consider as a good repository. Some ideas of such projects that we all come across are:
1. Well-defined project structure
2. Good coding practices like indentations and comments
3. A comprehensible ReadMe file (what we hope to provide with this one)
4. A brief `How to use` guide
5. Some automated workflows
